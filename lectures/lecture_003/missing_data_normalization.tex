\section{Missing Data and Normalization}

\textbf{Feature selection} is one of the main stages in creating machine learning models, as in most cases, data contains more information than necessary. Feature selection not only improves model quality but also optimizes computational resource usage, such as efficient storage and memory utilization during the training process.

In addition to feature selection, \textbf{data transformations} are performed. Data transformation is necessary to adapt data to classification problems, since data are typically not defined under the same numerical scales and in certain cases follow different distributions.
